# Library production operations

Production changes to Library are executed only through the checked-in Make targets in
this repository. Do not substitute dashboard clicks, inline shell, `curl`, or a temporary
script during a release. A production deploy still requires independent review and
explicit human approval.

## Ownership and profile assets

The executable service tooling lives here with the service so it is versioned, tested,
and available to every operator. The deployer's team-private shelf skill records how to
use these targets. That skill is evolved through Library's reviewed
`propose -> approve -> refresh` asset flow; a locally edited materialized skill is not a
source of truth. The public deployer blueprint carries only the portable rule to use a
service's reviewed targets rather than improvising production mutations.

## Pinned production topology

`ops/render-production.json` is the fail-closed topology allowlist. The tooling refuses
to proceed if Render reports a different service ID, name, region, repository, branch,
origin URL, suspension state, or auto-deploy setting.

The Render API key is read from `~/.aweb-render/env`. The file must have mode `0600` and
contain exactly one nonempty `RENDER_API_KEY`. Commands never print the key, headers, or
raw authenticated materialization responses.

### Why `render.yaml` is not the production identity source

The root `render.yaml` entered the repository unchanged with the initial scaffold
(`c621010`), whose commit records that the Render file was copied from Folio and renamed.
It still carries the inherited `library-api` / `oregon` template values; no later commit
made those values a Library production-topology decision. They do not identify the live
service.

Do not use `render.yaml` to select a production target or derive a deploy plan. Production
is `srv-d8qm4jvavr4c73dhrmgg`, named `library`, in `virginia`, with generated origin
`https://library-02jf.onrender.com` and public edge `https://library.aweb.ai`, as pinned in
`ops/render-production.json`. The checked-in operations validate that allowlist against
Render before acting.

Repository history does not establish whether the scaffold template was ever linked to
the live Render service. Until that relationship is verified from sanitized live
metadata, do not apply the template to production, delete it as presumed inert, or claim
that changing it changes the existing service.

### Credential-less topology boundary

A credential-less reader can identify the pinned production target from this repository
and can verify that both the generated origin and public edge serve the Library health
payload. Those public surfaces and headers do not expose the Render region. Render's
[documented automatic runtime metadata](https://render.com/docs/environment-variables#render-defined-environment-variables)
exposes service identity and origin fields, but no service-region field; a second manually
configured region string would be circular.

Region drift is therefore checked at the credentialed operations boundary, by design.
`make prod-status` reads the live Render API and fails closed unless every field in
`ops/render-production.json` matches, including `virginia`. Run that preflight before any
production operation; do not describe the public health response as region attestation.

## Required release record

Before requesting production approval, record all of the following:

- exact full lowercase 40-character candidate SHA, already at `origin/main`;
- exact current live rollback deploy ID and full commit SHA;
- exact expected developer shelf profile version and `sha256:` digest;
- expected rendered behavior for Claude Code and Pi;
- the independent review verdict;
- the human approval that names this service and candidate.

Never deploy a tag, short SHA, local `HEAD`, or an unmerged commit. Never infer the
rollback artifact after starting the deploy.

## Targets

| Target | Effect |
|---|---|
| `make prod-ops-test` | Mocked operations and gate tests; no network mutation. |
| `make prod-status` | Read-only topology and current-live-deploy preflight. |
| `make prod-health-client-proof ...` | Makes exactly two bounded canonical health requests: the known-blocked baseline UA must return 403 and the honest gate UA must return the exact 200 payload; persists both artifacts. |
| `make prod-gate-current-incumbent ...` | Read-only semantic probe of the exact pinned pre-aasb incumbent: authenticated generated-origin then mandatory public materialization for both runtimes, validating only the pinned legacy response shape. It does not prove the asserted deploy is live or emit AATK receipts. |
| `make prod-deploy ... APPLY=1` | Validates topology and rollback pin, fetches and verifies exact `origin/main`, starts a clear-cache deploy, waits for `live`, then waits boundedly for exact origin and public health readiness. |
| `make prod-wait ...` | Restartable read-only wait for one exact deploy ID and commit. |
| `make prod-verify ...` | Requires the exact deploy to be the sole live artifact, checks origin/public health, then runs generated-origin raw, public raw, released-client, and real-harness gates. |
| `make prod-rollback ... APPLY=1` | Pins the exact current live deployment, validates a distinct known-good rollback deploy ID/commit/state, rolls back, waits, re-checks the sole live artifact, and checks both health surfaces against the approved rollback commit. A pre-build-identity artifact additionally requires an explicit per-run `ALLOW_LEGACY_MISSING_BUILD_FOR` equal to that rollback commit. |
| `make prod-recovery ... APPLY=1` | Performs the pinned rollback and its explicitly selected recovery gate. |

Run `make prod-ops-test` before release planning. The mutation targets deliberately
require `APPLY=1` and `CONFIRM_SERVICE_ID=srv-d8qm4jvavr4c73dhrmgg` in addition to the
artifact pins. Deploy, verify, rollback, and health-client proof also require a fresh
absolute `PROD_EVIDENCE_DIR` outside the repository. The directory must not exist; its
parent must be an operator-owned exact-mode-0700 path with no symlink component. The tooling
retains no-follow directory descriptors, detects path replacement before and after publication,
creates the root at exact mode 0700, and
publishes no-replace mode-0600 versioned JSON artifacts. The initial manifest exists before any
mutation. Each artifact records verified source/config identity, exact nonsecret request
semantics, timing, bounded body bytes and their captured-byte digest/completeness, an allowlist
of diagnostic response headers, and bounded omitted header names/count but never omitted
values. A terminal outcome survives HTTP, DNS, TLS, timeout, and no-response failure. The
operator owns retention and cleanup.

The legacy-incumbent client proof requires its exact live commit and explicit missing-build pin:

```text
make prod-health-client-proof \
  CURRENT_COMMIT=<40-char-current-live> \
  ALLOW_LEGACY_MISSING_BUILD_FOR=<same-40-char-current-live> \
  PROD_EVIDENCE_DIR=/absolute/operator-owned/client-proof-run
```

Example deploy variable shape (placeholders only):

```text
make prod-deploy \
  APPLY=1 \
  CONFIRM_SERVICE_ID=srv-... \
  PROD_COMMIT=<40-char-candidate> \
  ROLLBACK_DEPLOY_ID=dep-... \
  ROLLBACK_COMMIT=<40-char-rollback> \
  PROD_EVIDENCE_DIR=/absolute/operator-owned/deploy-run
```

After the command returns the new deployment ID, verification is separate and explicit:

```text
make prod-verify \
  PROD_DEPLOY_ID=dep-... \
  PROD_COMMIT=<40-char-candidate> \
  PROD_EVIDENCE_DIR=/absolute/operator-owned/verify-run \
  AW_SOURCE_HOME=/absolute/path/to/certified-agent-home \
  EXPECTED_PROFILE_VERSION=<approved-shelf-version> \
  EXPECTED_PROFILE_DIGEST=sha256:<64-hex-digest>
```

`AW_SOURCE_HOME` must be an established agent home with the correct team certificate.
The gate clones only into a private temporary directory and removes it on exit.

## AATK verification contract

`ops/aatk-manifest.json` is the checked-in static coverage specification. The actual
postdeploy executors own stable child predicate IDs in `scripts/render_ops.py` and
`scripts/library_prod_gate.py`; `make aatk-predicate-inventory` exposes those IDs and
`make aatk-spec-check` requires exact equality with the manifest rows. The required CI
workflow invokes the structural check directly.

Runtime proof never lives in that manifest. A future run ledger is external, immutable,
and bound to the manifest digest and exact candidate SHA. `make aatk-validate-preplan
AATK_EVIDENCE_INDEX=...` and `make aatk-validate-release AATK_EVIDENCE_INDEX=...` are
separate lifecycle validators. In the current first honest increment, a structurally valid
fixture ledger reaches `unenforced-obligation` and enumerates every deferred enforcement
ID; an invalid or missing ledger may correctly fail its own earlier structural check. The
load-bearing invariant is that neither lifecycle validator can return success while a
deferred ID remains. Only static schema validation can pass. Therefore this increment
cannot authorize a deployment plan or close a release.

Every predicate row structurally requires a typed positive, a same-declared-path faithful
negative, strict postdeploy obligation, owner, rollback disposition, and machine expiry.
Candidate-only absence is source-allowlisted to semantics the exact incumbent cannot emit;
it requires an exact-source positive and cannot waive shared transport or environment.
The deferred registry machine-blocks preplan and release until runtime path fidelity,
actual execution obligations, separate incumbent/rollback identity semantics, immutable
fresh receipts, lifecycle transitions, safe boundary invocation, executed same-path
controls, candidate-only runtime proof, and orchestrator falsification are implemented and
tested. A status edit cannot clear those blockers because the validator cross-checks the
registry against source-owned enforcement IDs. The enforced claims, dedicated negative
tests, and explicit nonclaims for this increment are mapped in
[`aatk-increment-1.md`](aatk-increment-1.md).

## Verification surfaces

The isolated stack does not prove production routing, Cloudflare policy, deployed identity, or shelf state; production preflight does not prove candidate bytes are live; only exact-ID post-deploy verification can close a deployment.

Real Claude Code and Pi harnesses run against the isolated exact-source signed stack before
planning. The fast production preflight validates the installed harness identities but does
not require candidate semantics from legacy production. A production-backed fresh-home harness
is reserved for exact-ID post-deploy verification. Real harness launches consume bounded
provider requests, and authenticated materialization consumes team-authorized requests; these
probes do not mutate Render state, but they are not free and their budget must be explicit.
CI cannot prove the reviewed artifact is the one currently live or that Cloudflare and Render accept the production client; production smoke cannot substitute for source-level customer journeys.
A paid-provider launch which cannot run in PR CI is a named protected integration smoke, not an
excuse to leave reproducible server semantics in the deploy gate.

### AATK matrix worked example: build identity across a legacy incumbent

The post-deploy build-identity predicate is intentionally unsatisfiable against the current
pre-AASR incumbent: that exact artifact has no `build` key, while candidate deploy/verify
correctly require an exact `build.git_sha`. Its matrix row must not weaken that candidate
predicate to manufacture a green incumbent result. Instead it records separate cells:

- current-production transport/client positive: the exact two-key payload is accepted only
  under `ALLOW_LEGACY_MISSING_BUILD_FOR` pinned to the exact incumbent commit;
- exact-candidate semantic positive: the isolated signed stack must serve the three-key payload
  with the exact candidate SHA;
- negative predicates: missing build without the pin, null build, malformed build, wrong SHA,
  and a pin naming any other commit all fail for their asserted reason;
- exact-ID post-deploy: origin and canonical public payloads both identify the deployed SHA;
- expiry: the preflight exception dies when the candidate is live, while rollback compatibility
  dies only when the approved pre-AASR rollback artifact is replaced.

This is a worked row, not the complete machine-visible AATK table. The incomplete table still
blocks a deployment plan. It also records a CI boundary observed in practice: protected Library
CI was green for AASR, but could not exercise its new checker against the live legacy artifact
or a rollback to that artifact.

Render metadata and health do not prove the functional release. Verification requires:

1. Render reports the exact candidate deploy ID and commit as the sole `live` deploy.
2. Generated origin `/health` returns the exact Library health payload without redirecting:
   `{status: "ok", service: "library", build: {git_sha: <full lowercase 40-hex SHA>}}`.
   The SHA must equal the approved commit. Render's documented `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` is
   authoritative; `LIBRARY_GIT_SHA` is only a validated non-Render fallback, and
   conflicting values make the service fail configuration validation. A null SHA is a
   current-shape local/uninjected failure state, normal only in local development; it never
   means the artifact agrees with an approved commit. Deployed pre-AASR artifacts instead
   omit `build` entirely and serve the exact two-key legacy shape described below.
3. Public edge `/health` returns the same exact payload without URL drift, and its
   `build.git_sha` independently equals the approved commit. A different valid SHA is
   treated as bounded stale-transition evidence; malformed or null identity fails
   immediately outside the explicit legacy rollback action described below.
   Render's `live` transition can precede request readiness. The checked-in gate retries
   only explicitly transient connection, timeout, invalid-JSON, and allowlisted HTTP
   failures for at most 90 seconds with five-second backoff. Redirects, authentication
   failures, and wrong health payloads fail immediately; exhaustion fails closed. Every
   retry and success records its attempt count and elapsed seconds in the release log.
   The 90-second initial bound is provisional rather than an observed Library recovery
   time: Render's documented zero-downtime sequence retains the old process for 60
   seconds after switching networking, and this bound covers that documented transition
   window plus a 30-second operator safety margin. Review observed readiness durations
   after real releases and tighten or extend the bound only from evidence.
4. Authenticated generated-origin `POST /v1/materialize` succeeds for `claude-code`
   and `pi`, before any authenticated public-edge probe.
5. Authenticated public `POST /v1/materialize` succeeds for both runtimes.
6. `managed_set` is positionally identical to `home_files`, with no duplicates,
   noncanonical paths, broken links, or links resolving outside the generated home.
7. The canonical `/opt/homebrew/bin/aw` strict client matches the reviewed 1.34.0
   SHA-256 plus version/commit/build metadata and materializes both runtimes into fresh
   homes; a self-reported version string alone is insufficient.
8. Real Claude Code and Pi harnesses load the generated title and provenance line.

The generated-origin functional probe separates the request's logical authority from its
socket route without separating its security authority. The pinned `aw` command still
requests `https://library.aweb.ai/v1/materialize`, so the signed audience, TLS SNI, HTTP
Host, method, path, and body hash remain canonical. Before each runtime probe, a
loopback-only CONNECT tunnel resolves the generated and public hostnames once, refuses
any address-set overlap, selects one generated numeric address, and accepts only one
`library.aweb.ai:443` connection. It removes ambient proxy/fallback settings, forwards
opaque TLS bytes only to that selected address, never terminates TLS or reads
authentication material, and performs no later DNS lookup or alternate-address retry.
The gate requires exact HTTP 200, validates the full materialization payload, verifies
that the kernel-observed peer is the selected address, and records that safe peer IP in
the release output. It then closes the tunnel and runs the public probe normally.

This tunnel deliberately bypasses the aweb-controlled Cloudflare zone on
`library.aweb.ai`; reaching Render ingress without that zone is what makes it an origin
probe. Consequently, it does not exercise the public zone's WAF/browser-signature rules,
cache, routing, or other edge configuration and cannot establish that the path users take
is healthy. It proves only bypass of the public hostname address set observed by the same
resolver at startup and functional behavior behind Render ingress. It does not prove a
dedicated backend process, globally disjoint CDN address ownership, or bypass of every
shared Render ingress/edge layer.

The authenticated canonical public-edge probe remains mandatory and runs after both
origin runtime probes. Any public probe failure aborts the candidate gate; origin success
cannot substitute for it, mask it, or produce an overall pass. TLS certificate validation,
canonical audience validation, and the service's single allowed audience remain
unchanged on both paths.

The harness artifact check has a deliberate boundary. It proves the exact reviewed
Claude native executable and the exact Pi entry script, run by the exact reviewed Node
interpreter through absolute paths and an allowlisted minimal environment and `PATH`.
Claude's pinned artifact is separately verified as a native Mach-O executable with no
interpreter lookup layer. These checks prevent
accidental interpreter interception and half-installed operator environments. It does
not claim per-run integrity of Pi's installed dependency tree; that tree is trusted as
part of the reviewed package installation. This gate does not defend a compromised local
machine that can also rewrite the Makefile or gate itself.

Do not send an authenticated materialization request whose URL is the generated Render
origin. That request is signed for the generated audience; Library correctly rejects it
with 401 because the only allowed audience is the canonical public origin. This expected
audience rejection is not evidence that the product failed at the origin. The supported
origin probe instead keeps the canonical URL and audience and changes only the pinned
socket route. Never add the generated origin as an allowed audience or weaken the
canonical audience comparison.

### Exact current-incumbent semantic probe

`prod-gate-current-incumbent` exists so the AATK preplan system can later replay the same
AATD transport and public-continuation semantics against untouched known-good production.
It requires all three identity assertions on every invocation, with no drifting defaults:

- service `srv-d8qm4jvavr4c73dhrmgg`;
- deploy `dep-d9koecdbedkc73b582vg`;
- commit `3376af7ee4a571488441794047018af94b06057f`.

Any missing or different assertion fails before a functional request. The mode then uses
the canonical signed URL through the numeric generated-origin route for `claude-code` and
`pi`, followed by mandatory canonical-public materialization for both runtimes. Every
response must match the exact pre-aasb fingerprint: the approved profile pin is present,
while `runtime_kind` and `managed_set` are absent rather than empty. A public failure is
fatal after origin success. Candidate mode remains separate and still requires exact
candidate identity plus `runtime_kind`, positional `managed_set`, strict-client success,
and real-harness success; incumbent compatibility never relaxes it.

The target emits a source-owned 22-predicate current-incumbent inventory and each predicate's
exact ordered path. AATK registers all 22 by domain and owner. Its source-owned semantic
comparator proves only four one-to-one candidate identities: public HTTP-200 and profile-pin
for each runtime. The other 18 mappings remain deferred, including all legacy response-shape
checks. Target output is diagnostic class `current-incumbent-debug`, which lifecycle validation
forbids as evidence alongside capability fixtures.

The AATK 2B contract fixture calls `run_current_incumbent` directly and instruments only the
four origin/public HTTP-200 assertions. It keeps the real tunnel and raw-materialize path while
substituting leaf DNS, loopback upstream, and released-aw process boundaries. That fixture does
not exercise this Make target, parser/main selection, or released-aw artifact verification, and
its transcript is forbidden as lifecycle evidence.

The target deliberately does **not** query Render to prove that the asserted deploy is currently
live, enforce same-path receipt execution, publish an AATK receipt, authorize a plan, or grant
live-execution authority. Those identity, receipt, orchestration, and authority controls belong
to later AATK enforcement. The mode and its legacy fingerprint expire when this exact incumbent
can no longer be the serving or approved rollback artifact; do not repoint the constants to
another artifact.

## Rollback and recovery

A failed functional gate means the release is not verified. Pin both the exact candidate
deployment currently being rolled away and the pre-recorded known-good rollback ID and
commit; do not choose a convenient artifact from the dashboard. The rollback target
must be a previously live artifact (`live` or Render's historical `deactivated` state),
never a failed build with a matching commit.

For the `aweb-aasb` rollout only, `prod-recovery` has the explicit `legacy-aasb`
fingerprint: both raw runtime responses omit (rather than merely empty)
`runtime_kind` and `managed_set`, and released strict materialization rejects both with
the exact runtime-schema error. An unrelated auth, route, network, or process failure
does not certify recovery:

```text
make prod-recovery \
  APPLY=1 \
  CONFIRM_SERVICE_ID=srv-... \
  CURRENT_DEPLOY_ID=dep-... \
  CURRENT_COMMIT=<40-char-current-live> \
  ROLLBACK_DEPLOY_ID=dep-... \
  ROLLBACK_COMMIT=<40-char-rollback> \
  ALLOW_LEGACY_MISSING_BUILD_FOR=<same-40-char-rollback> \
  PROD_EVIDENCE_DIR=/absolute/operator-owned/recovery-run \
  AW_SOURCE_HOME=/absolute/path/to/certified-agent-home \
  EXPECTED_PROFILE_VERSION=<approved-shelf-version> \
  EXPECTED_PROFILE_DIGEST=sha256:<64-hex-digest>
```

`ALLOW_LEGACY_MISSING_BUILD_FOR` is never defaulted or stored as an exception list. It is
accepted only when it is a full SHA exactly equal to the approved target for that invocation.
It accepts only the established two-key `{"status":"ok","service":"library"}` shape;
null `build.git_sha`, malformed build identity, and any other payload still fail. Naming a
different commit fails before a request or rollback mutation. Candidate deploy and verify
never set this exception and always require exact `build.git_sha` equality.

For the read-only incumbent preflight, this exception expires as soon as the build-identified
candidate becomes live. For rollback/recovery, it remains only while the exact pre-AASR
artifact is the approved rollback target and must be removed when that target is replaced by a
verified build-identified artifact. No deployed Library artifact ever emitted a present
`{"build":{"git_sha":null}}` shape, so the speculative null-build exception was removed
rather than broadened alongside the real legacy contract.

Do not reuse `legacy-aasb` for a later release. Add and review the later release's exact
recovery fingerprint before its production approval.

## 2026-07-29 live-transition readiness incident

The approved `aweb-aasb` attempt acquired its production lock at `03:46:38Z` and
created candidate deploy `dep-d9knfetaeets739qep20` at
`f3c0846f4f3ac0ba73503f82dbedce7eb5aee13b`. Render reported it `live`, but the
immediate no-redirect public health check raised `HTTPError`, so the reviewed plan
correctly initiated recovery before functional verification. The safe command output
recorded the build, update, and live sequence but not an exact timestamp for each
candidate transition; recovery was already requested by `03:48:20Z`. Recovery created
`dep-d9kng0vqj5pc73dlk52g` at the known-good
`3376af7ee4a571488441794047018af94b06057f`; Render records that rollback as created at
`03:48:20Z` and live at `03:48:43Z`. Its identical immediate public health check also
raised `HTTPError`.

An exact-ID `prod-wait` 15 seconds later confirmed only that the rollback remained
`live`; it does not check health, and the initial operator report was corrected after
code inspection. `prod-gate-recovery` then successfully sent authenticated public
materialization requests for both runtimes and passed the exact legacy fingerprint,
which proves public application traffic recovered without another deploy. The
coordinator independently observed public `/health` return 200 later, but did not time
that observation. Therefore the health-specific recovery interval is unmeasured.

Because the known-good artifact exhibited the same immediate failure and then served
both authenticated application traffic and health without another deploy, the evidence
ruled out a candidate-specific persistent defect. The initial readiness-race explanation
was an unconfirmed hypothesis, not the incident cause. A later controlled comparison
established that Cloudflare on the canonical zone returned browser-signature error 1010 only
for the default `Python-urllib/3.12` User-Agent; the same exact client reached the generated
origin, while multiple honest User-Agents reached the canonical health URL. The four evidenced
canonical probe failures plus the controlled one-variable responses rule out rate limiting and
a Python-client class block. The rejected requests never reached Library. A third deploy
attempt preserved exact HTTP 403 for both candidate and rollback but still discarded the
response artifact. The gate now identifies itself as
`aweb-library-deploy-gate/1.0`, persists bounded sanitized evidence before raising,
and retains the bounded readiness retry only as preventive hardening for a distinct
plausible failure class. The candidates were not verified and must not be reported as
deployed.

Initial-bound basis: Render documents that after updating networking to route traffic to
the new instance it waits 60 seconds before signaling the original instance to stop:
<https://render.com/docs/deploys#zero-downtime-deploys>. Render health checks can take up
to 15 minutes to certify a new instance, but this incident occurred after Render had
already marked each deploy live, so that larger pre-live limit is not used as the
post-live gate bound: <https://render.com/docs/health-checks>.
